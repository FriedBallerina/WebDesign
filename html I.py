# Web Design I
# HTML

# Toronto Public Library
# 3 main pillars of web design:
# content = HTML, styles = CSS, and functionality = JS
# End result of the course: a website from scratch

# when saving a file in brackets (or other software)
# add .html
# brackets has live preview which is handy to
# see the progress as you work on your file

# some of the popular code editors: brackets, atom, vcs

# html is about content, not looks
# markup description: we take content and describe what the content type is
# syntax of a programming language is similar to grammar in natural language
# html has one of the simplest syntax sets of any coding languages
#for the most part, every line of code starts with a tag which describes the content
# the tag is enclosed in brackets. The content is inside the brackets.
# Usually it is followed by a closing tag.

# html 'boiler plate' = a template you always start with
#<!DOCTYPE html>
#<html lang="en">
#<head>
#    <meta charset="utf-8">
#</head>
#</html>

# head = background information like keywords for search engines,
#links to stylesheets etc.
# body = holds the visual content the users can see
# file -> extension manager -> beautify add-on is handy

# <a href=#> placeholder, makes the link clickable but doesn't take you anywhere :)

#   HOMEWORK:
# think of smth you want to make a website about
# take all of the sections and see if you can put in
# your own content, footer etc. so you get a customised page.
